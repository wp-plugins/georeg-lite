Tansparently capture geographic information anytime a new user registers on your site.


== Description ==

GeoReg Lite captures the IP address, country name, and country code of new users who register on your site. It’s completely transparent and works behind the scenes without any setup or configuration. 

GeoReg Lite is built by the AppThemes team who also offers a full-blown [GeoReg plugin](http://marketplace.appthemes.com/plugins/georeg/ "GeoReg geographic info plugin from AppThemes") in their popular plugins and child-themes [Marketplace](http://marketplace.appthemes.com/ "WordPress Plugins and Child-Themes from AppThemes"). It captures much more detailed information, works with WordPress Multisite, BuddyPress, and bbPress, and includes dedicated support.
